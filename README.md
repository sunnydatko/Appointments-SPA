# Appointments-SPA
This codebase was created to demonstrate an Angular application that interacts with a .NET Core Web API.

## Functionality Overview
The example application is an appointment queue for a veterinarian's office. It allows the users to confirm or reschedule appointments, and undo their actions.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installed globally. 

Run `ng serve` for the dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run the source code for the Web API server, which can be found in the [Appointments.API repo](https://github.com/sunnydatko/Appointments.API).
